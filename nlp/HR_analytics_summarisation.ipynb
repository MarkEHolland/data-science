       "'Regularly decisions have to made by committee as no one person is accountable for anything. Trying to figure out who can make a call on anything as a result is difficult. as agents I believe we  need more control over  accounts and the credit limit for us needs to be raised as they is always checks made on agent to justify the credits given and this would also take a way time from mangers having to pick this up  as front line agents been able to offer adjustments that are needed on the account if they is a mistake from us  this would save on transfer to the billing rec team  Although we are one company we still work in silos sometimes.  Trying to get people to take ownership and accountability for anything can be very challenging and timewasting.  Time wasted trying to find the right person to speak to. the basic are missed no one is held to account and takes ownership any more Was torn between accountability and processes and procedures. Whilst a think processes and procedures play a big part in preventing change from being straightforward I believe if more people took greater accountability and ownership of problems and challenges we encounter that it would make life a lot easier whilst the bigger and longer challenge of tackling the processes and procedures is worked on. Lack of ownership and indeed interest from key CFU stakeholders in being accountable for security Agents from Sheffield and Leeds make constant mistakes and feedback never seems to be properly passed down. No one will own up to an issue and when calls come through with large issues agents just pass it on and pass it on. A new feedback system needs to be created so agents can ensure when raising feedback its actually getting taken into consideration  office based staff appear to pass on emails rather than take responsibility for the job and see it through to a conclusion. I wish I could have selected most of the boxes. In BT you can be empowered but people in wider teams can make decisions that counteract that.Not enough consistency in approach to how we do BTwide transformation i.e. TBWP. Too much focus on howwhy we shouldnt do things rather than howwhy we CAN. personne dans les niveaux au dessus nose prendre des responsabilits et on ne me permet pas den avoir non plus'"

Always down to the SD manager to chase feedback and challenged on things that are out of their control.  Getting things done requires too many sign offs and too many hoops to jump through. Its not clear how our work is valued across the organisation. Decisions are made at a senior level without proper thought of how we actually achieve the goals set with the resource provided. It then becomes the blame game when it goes wrong. There needs to be more discussion around fundamental decisions with the boots on the ground. Quite often processes fall to the same people as not enough people have the knowledge experience or time to take any responsibility for change. Bringing new people into change projects leaving current contingent of staff without ownership or proper control slows down progress. Legacy staff do have the know how and would like to see positive change and arent always the cause of needing it in the first place.  I feel that patch managers are the only people accountable when it comes to control wayleaves or planning for example there is a huge lack of accountability which makes life tougher than it has to be. We can provide better service if we fix this.  Accountability in the fact of other companys putting in our fibre network and half arseing it Putting it in wrong poorly and not up to our standard to which we have to then go and sort out and figure out what the hell it is theyve done Wasting more time and money.

So long as their small part is working they dont care to look at the bigger picture and imagine how much simpler things would be if they went the extra mile. Finding the right person in Openreach to deal with a query is difficult. Finding a person who will willingly help you resolve it is often impossible. The issue is passed from person to person but not resolved because its too difficult or not their job or out of scope. Real change starts from a culture of everybody being willing to help others. Same faces contributing very little to the task at hand No accountability or ownership when things go wrong. We give people a pat on the back for job well done and what they have delivered doesnt work Our business is too task driven with not enough focus on the customer and what it takes to give them what they need. I see a lack of ownership in the FND regions to do the right thing Bottle necks on my teams way are clear and obvious. However there is no accountability for delays and failures in those areas.  Everyone above lvl1 management seem to have a pass the buck attitude and its left to us engineers to get anything sorted Parts of jobs are sent to multiple engineers at different times. There isnt much ownership on jobs so it can be difficult to resolve issues that someone has left in the past without knowing why certain things have been done the way they have. If there was more ownership of a complete area or seeing a job through from start to finish then it would be a lot easier to identify any issues that may come up also identify who has been working on that job. This would then hopefully create engineers taking more pride in their work and raising standards of the work completed. It should be all about working positively together and feeling proud of the work thats been done. As well as this on new sites there needs to be more surveyingchecks done on the quality of work done by contractors prior to a customer moving in and an engineer being sent to a job to avoid any DSOs coming up.

This needs to be the same for senior leaders towards managers to drive a culture change of support. There is a lack of clear accountability across all levels and business units within Openreach.We consistently fail to analyse our performance critically and revert back to outdated methods of management and engage in toxic blame culture rather than taking a holistic data driven perspective of our own failings.  I think some can go through their work day and not do as much as other people and nothing could be said. Sometimes its unfair the work people can put in in comparison to others who can take it easy by maybe not knowing as much. It is nobody fault but maybe some accountability personally to learn and get same knowledge as other people    Theres a severe lack of accountability. Survey tasks are poorly managed across many departments. The number of interventions in the vast majority of L2C survey tasks is superfluous and allows errors to occur without any learning or improvement.

People dont performance manage and accept mediocre. There is a complete lack of urgency from people to get work done these days leaders need to ensure teams are stepping up to expectations Little strategic direction. Decisions are driven by the wrong metrics and made to fit existing process  i.e. having revenue growth based on CX differentiation as the primary driver for a project but having to build the business case on TLRTLC reduction as it is the only thing finance will accept. Accountability for decision making is not delegated effectively no product ownership have to get a number of senior leaders to all agree to make small changes.

Personally I will always endeavour to assist where we can to progress an issue but due to the sheer volumes of whats our responsibility you have to push back. Many new AMs and ADs are constantly complaining about billing issues or an overall BT process they think we can stop and putting the customer in copy. Im pressured by AMs to come on calls with customers about billing complaints and they make no distinction between the different areas and seem to think we are responsible for everything and want us to give billing assurances to the customer. You have to address the issue delicately  and advise you can take forward any billing issues with ME but cant preempt billing problems from within collections. It has never been more difficult than in 2021 after the May account realignments and to present. The business needs a matrix of responsibility as collections are being pulled into issues taking us away from collections. AMs do not appreciate the volumes we have and think we can instantly deal with their request and copying in customers to what should only be internal BT exchanges. We as a team have many emails to demonstrate this and their quick escalations to managers. With your name as PCC on an account they dont know where else to go. Ive had to instruct many they are responsible for putting through ceases as they come to us these again with customers in copy. Weve been asked to supply customer contracts by new AMs who think we hold these and there just seems to be a shift for the worse in this area which has made things difficult.                                                   I rely on a service from technical teams however when they fail I have to have the face to face with the customer to explain why deliver has failed while trying not to make BT look back. The technical teams do not seem bothered about meeting timescales and think it is easy to move dates when they fil to complete work in time. Too many roles and responsibilities so noone feels they need to step up and lead or make meaningful change Micromanaging and not listened to when pointing out something isnt working. When it goes wrong the micromanaging is stopped and all blame put in engineers. Cant be more clear without naming names  One of the team I worked with do not take ownership nor urgency in their function. This indirectly affect the overall poor performance in delivering of our services to customers. eg. Duplicate effort delays time waste in continuous of follow up emails  calls Spesso non sono chiari i ruoli e le responsabilit  delle persone e questo crea una situazione di enpasse e conflitti di responsabilit  tra le strutture. Clear ownership would be a good start. Definitive processes however good or bad are needed and should be controlled by the owner. Only then can you manage change effectively.

Accountability ResourcingI have authority to make decisions and where I am responsible for actioning thats great. Where I have to rely on other teams there is insufficient resource to deliver on those decisions.Lack of resource in other teams also results in poor attention to detail and an obvious lack of pride in the outputwork.  I hope that as we transition back to the office this improves. the same mistakes happen over and over people arent trained anymore. They only know how to work a system called Albert.  Unclear accountability on new org structure in Digital teams not certain on how it would impact my role. all other departments we deal with are faceless Due to challenges and competing priorities it is difficult to get our partners to deliver our contracts on time.  Very little Accountability our role is dependent on people being Accountable for what they are doing however it feels as though people have lost interest and going through the motions. Its not always clear who is responsible for challenges in the workplace issues that come up on jobs  Other teams fibre allocation are not taking responsibility for their tasks and it can be a nightmare chasing for updates or to get orders moving. They need to be made accountable for order failures.</td>\n",

I feel that some change is difficult due to no overall owner for certain areas. If noone has an overall joined up view of everything from the concept through design delivery and then inlife it can be difficult to have decisions made at a holistic level. There is no accountability for the contractors used by Openreach this can only be resolved by Openreach senior level leaders making them accountable which in turn will support the boots on the ground who try to make them accountable and enforce the terms of contracts. . There is a lot of role overlap too many stakeholders involved on everything therefore confusion around ownership everything is deemed a priority from project teams too waterfall still in how we operate with other areas of the business. BVP should be deemed a centre of excellence on marketing comms and be able to advise best approach with activity. Too much comes through as a demand request with lack of BVP advising on best approach to deliver the challenge business issue its just a straightforward we can or cant support. Lack of understanding around contractual agreements with partners  BVP should be feeding into those and advising being the champions of the customer. They need review with a clear roadmap of activity rather than waiting for them to come down a pipeline as many are recurring. Every day feels like groundhog day. Where is the passing over of IP between staff to prevent starting from scratch everytime. It requires a centralised local drive so people can navigate around and share documents better. We are regularly left waiting for decisionsinformation that enable us to do our own job. This results in having to use assumptions and guesswork rather than solid data which we then get challenged on as well as having to rush through large pieces of work at short notice. If there was greater accountability throughout the business to make timely decisions and governance around timeframes when information is shared this would take a lot of pain out of our day to day role.  Support functions do not work effectively which leads to extra workload on Patch Managers. If support functions took more ownership and accountability for their areas of work this would certainly help. decision making is diluted and confusing at times with varying levels of empowerment too many shared responsibilities between group and rest of the business or lack of communication  accountability. lots of figure pointing about who does what work often lands in the lap of those who are more proactive which is not fair As senior level there is no consequences to poor performance or missing targets  as long as overall operational target is achieved we dont look at the how</td>\n",

It would be a great idea if both Tania Caporaso and Nick Lane could log on and listen to the odd call and see live what they think about the service our customers are getting if agents think not only can there manager listen to them live but so can senior management I know they would treat people our customers better which would strengthen our position in the market place as the telecoms that truly help. During the covid pandemic in 2020 we were asked to be kinder to our customers as we may be the only person they spoke to that day I know were no longer in lock down for now anyway but I still feel we should be kind on all our calls but now it seems we are being asked to make the calls as short as possible talk about mixed messages from the powers that be I am sorry but if Im talking to an elderly person or even someone quite young if they sound down or lonely Ill have a chat whilst running their diagnostic and sometimes that takes time but the comments from my customers at the end of my calls where customers pick up on the personal nature the call has taken and always thank me for taking the time to chat understand and confirm without jargon in plane English we should speak to customers the way we would treat an old friend not as a chore our interactions should always be friendly even if the customer is really cross and shouting we should always put ourselves in their shoes and see what the cause is whilst speaking very calmly and listening to the customer not making assumptions and not interrupting I find that Mr or Mrs shout a lot usually have good cause and almost always because a previous agent hasnt done what they have said or promised something the customer is not going to get I know people agents dont like giving bad new  but sometimes in this job we have to deliver news that the customer will object to but we should always be open and honest and at least explain why to our customers thats the job and if we all did it as we were trained to in a nut shell the result would be happier customers and fewer calls that we could actually in good time but this will only ever be achieved with our hierarchy getting more hands on and feed back and training to the agents who are getting it wrong.  Better accountability for mistakes and rectifying them  I dont think we are getting the balance right between promoting confidence in our company vs our Group being in a tricky place financially so all of us needing to do whatever we can to deliver. Lacks management of management Too many people from engineers to desk based people need to own the problem in front of them. Not hope the next person will deal with it. lack of accountability and role clarity There is absolutely no point in forwarding any comments as any feedback or situations raised will be likely ignored whitewashed shelved buried sanitised or delayed. As a patch manager we ultimately pick up the pieces from every decision made from above or far and wide. Being the final team in most chains we end up being the measure of success when all throughout processes other teams are allowed to take no accountability for their actions. WAC TEFWAC Planners to name a few. Accountability and collaboration if two options could be chosen  theres often a focus on individual elements of a process with limited accountability or willingness to consider and understand the wider process i.e. that part isnt my responsibility. Finding the right person to help can be difficult. When things arent done by the centre there seems to be little to no accountability. Given the impact that this can have on my store and our staff system outages reporting failing to work support teams being understaffed to the point it delays getting simple things done nothing seems to happen.

Makes us look unprofessional  Lack of communication between different departments get to jobs and waiting round for update for example TM and no TM turns up wasting time and money  Lots of jobs passed from dept to dept and no communication between them and enduser has to wait as a result There are often times we will arrive to a site or job only to discover that previous work is wholly or partially incomplete. Communication is lacking in key areas such as the status of A55s OCR work etc.</td>\n",

Utilising far too many sharepointsservices and then spreading bits of information amongst various locations. This makes a simple 5 minute hunt for information an all day task. We are all on the same team however sometimes when dealing with other areas of the company you it feels like people at working against you rather than with you. That resistance can make a easy task a little more stressful. I will add this isnt all the time and most people are great   There seems to be a large sum of Miscommunications across the Team and a struggle to get down to the bottom of some issues  Job packs and up to date details are not always accurateavailable. Accurate notes on job progressionoutstanding tasks not always available. Poor task management and lack of direction causing some confusion on daytoday work Nobody talks to anyone any more. no team meetings. I cannot tell you the last time I seen a manager or a senior manager. Things change regularly in our department which leads to people holding old information as current information which in turn leads to people having opposite opinions on the same situation. We are required to be adaptable which I dont think anyone has a problem with but sometimes it seems as though the changes we make to policies or to procedures are reactive and dont actually make sense in terms of the given situations. The communication for the changing of policies and procedures should be clearer and more regular so that everyone is up to date on the newest information. Either that or we as a department need to reign in how many changes are being made and how regularly. Its one thing being adaptable but when it leads to differences in the quality of work on an individual basis due to a knowledge gap in the latest changes it doesnt send a message to our customers that they can be confident in.  The communication between the company sectors including what customers are told to information that engineers receive is usually what causes most distress in situations. Specifically where an engineer has not been given all the details or a customer has been given incorrect information from the telephone service side. Also if jobs are passed from one team to another to ensure that the team who receives the job are given all information before attending the job Too many barriers between different parts of the business.  Local call centres makes communication between both parties much easier.</td>\n",
